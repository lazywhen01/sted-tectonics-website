      <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-left">
                  The crust is everything we can see and study directly. The thinnest layer of the Earth, the crust still measures about 40 km on average, ranging from 5–70 km (~3–44 miles) in depth. But at the scale of the planet, that’s less than the skin of an apple.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-left">
                  There are two types of crust: continental and oceanic crust. Oceanic crust can be found at the bottom of the oceans or below the continental crust; it is generally harder and deeper, consisting of denser rocks like basalt, while continental crust contains granite-type rocks and sediments. The continental crust thicker on land. The crust is not one rigid thing, but it’s split into several tectonic plates. These tectonic plates are not stationary, but are in relative motion one from another. Depending on the relationship and geologic setting, there are three types of tectonic plate boundaries: convergent (moving one toward the other), divergent (moving away from the other) and transformant (moving laterally).
                </p>
      <br>
                <h2 data-aos="fade-left">Mantle</h2>
      <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-left">
                  The mantle extends down 2,890 km, making it the thickest layer of Earth. It makes up about 84% of Earth’s volume. Everything we know about the mantle we know indirectly, as no human study managed to go beyond the crust. Most of the things we know about the mantle we know from seismologic studies (more on that later). The mantle is also divided into several layers, based on seismologic properties. The upper mantle extends from where the crust ends to about 670 km. Even though this area is regarded as viscous, you can also consider it as formed from rock – a rock called peridotite to be more precise. Below that, the lower mantle extends from 670 to almost 2900 kilometers below the surface.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-left">
                  It’s basically accepted by now that the mantle is not in a steady state, but rather in a state of constant motion. There is a general convective circulation, with hot material upwelling towards the surface and cooler material going deeper. It is generally thought that this convection actually directs the circulation of the plate tectonics in the crust.
                </p>
      <br>
                <h2 data-aos="fade-left">Core</h2>
      <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-left">
                  We sometimes refer to the core as one thing, although the inner core and the outer core are fundamentally different – not layers of the same thing. The  “solid” inner core has a radius of ~1,220 km, while the “liquid” outer core extends up to a radius of ~3,400 km. Wait, if we couldn’t go to the mantle, how could we possibly know one is solid and one isn’t? Well, as before, the answer is the same: seismic waves (we’re almost there).
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-left">
                  The temperatures and pressures of the inner core are absolutely extreme, at approximately 5,400 °C (9,800 °F) and 330 to 360 gigapascals (3,300,000 to 3,600,000 atm). It’s generally believed that the inner core is growing very slowly – as the core cools down, more of the outer core solidifies and becomes a part of the inner core. The cooling rate is very low thought, at about 100 degrees Celsius per billion years. However, even this slow growth is thought to have a significant impact in the generation of Earth’s magnetic field by dynamo action in the liquid outer core. Rather interestingly, the inner core seems to be asymmetric on the East-West line. There is a model that explains this asymmetry with melting on one side and crystallization on the other. This anomaly also likely affects the Earth’s magnetic field, creating an asymmetry on the crystallizing side.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-left">
                  The outer core is a low viscosity fluid (about ten times the viscosity of liquid metals at the surface) – “liquid” is a rather improper term. Because it has a very low viscosity, it is easily deformed and malleable. It is the site of violent convection. It is also thought to suffer very violent convection currents – hey, and guess what? The churning of the outer core and its relative movement is responsible for the Earth’s magnetic field. The hottest part of the outer core is actually hotter than the inner core; temperatures can reach 6,000° Celsius (10,800° Fahrenheit)—as hot as the surface of the sun.

          <p>
            The principal though of continental drift theory is that the continents are situated on slabs rock, or plates, and they have drifted across the surface of the earth over time.             However, originally, they were all joined together as a huge supercontinent at one time.

      <h3>Pangea</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Pangaea or Pangea (/pænˈdʒiː.ə/) was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras. It assembled from the earlier continental units of Gondwana, Euramerica and Siberia during the Carboniferous approximately 335 million years ago, and began to break apart about 200 million years ago, at the end of the Triassic and beginning of the Jurassic.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In contrast to the present Earth and its distribution of continental mass, Pangaea was centred on the equator and surrounded by the superocean Panthalassa and the Paleo-Tethys and subsequent Tethys Oceans. Pangaea is the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The name "Pangaea" is derived from Ancient Greek pan (πᾶν, "all, entire, whole") and Gaia or Gaea (Γαῖα, "Mother Earth, land"). The concept that the continents once formed a contiguous land mass was hypothesised, with corroborating evidence, by Alfred Wegener, the originator of the scientific theory of continental drift, in his 1912 publication The Origin of Continents (Die Entstehung der Kontinente). He expanded upon his hypothesis in his 1915 book The Origin of Continents and Oceans (Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane), in which he postulated that, before breaking up and drifting to their present locations, all the continents had formed a single supercontinent that he called the "Urkontinent".

      <h3>Panthalassa</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Panthalassa, also known as the Panthalassic Ocean or Panthalassan Ocean (from Greek πᾶν "all" and θάλασσα "sea"), was the superocean that surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea, the latest in a series of supercontinents in the history of Earth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        During the Paleozoic–Mesozoic transition c. 250 Ma it occupied almost 70% of Earth's surface. Its ocean floor has completely disappeared because of the continuous subduction along the continental margins on its circumference. Panthalassa is also referred to as the Paleo-Pacific ("old Pacific") or Proto-Pacific because the Pacific Ocean is a direct continuation of Panthalassa.

    <div class="col-md-7 pt-5 order-2 order-md-1" data-aos="fade-right">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The supercontinent Rodinia began to break up 870–845 Ma probably as a consequence of a superplume caused by mantle slab avalanches along the margins of the supercontinent. In a second episode c. 750 Ma the western half of Rodinia started to rift apart: western Kalahari and South China broke away from the western margins of Laurentia; and by 720 Ma Australia and East Antarctica had also separated. In the Early Jurassic the Pacific Plate opened originating from a triple junction between the Panthalassic Farallon, Phoenix, and Izanagi plates. Panthalassa can be reconstructed based on magnetic lineations and fracture zones preserved in the western Pacific.

                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text"> The asthenosphere (from Ancient Greek ἀσθενός (asthenós) 'without strength') is the mechanically weak and ductile region of the upper mantle of Earth. It lies below the lithosphere, at a depth between ~80 and 200 km (50 and 120 mi) below the surface, and extends as deep as 700 km (430 mi). However, the lower boundary of the asthenosphere is not well defined.

                  The asthenosphere is almost solid, but a slight amount of melting (less than 0.1% of the rock) contributes to its mechanical weakness. More extensive decompression melting of the asthenosphere takes place where it wells upwards, and this is the most important source of magma on Earth. It is the source of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and of some magmas that erupted above subduction zones or in regions of continental rifting.

               <h5 class="card-title">Lithosphere</h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">
                  The lithosphere is the solid, outer part of Earth. The lithosphere includes the brittle upper portion of the mantle and the crust, the outermost layers of Earth’s structure. It is bounded by the atmosphere above and the asthenosphere (another part of the upper mantle) below. Although the rocks of the lithosphere are still considered elastic, they are not viscous. The asthenosphere is viscous, and the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is the point where geologists and rheologists—scientists who study the flow of matter—mark the difference in ductility between the two layers of the upper mantle. Ductility measures a solid material’s ability to deform or stretch under stress. The lithosphere is far less ductile than the asthenosphere.

                The word TECTONICS is of Greek origin and it means ―to build. The word ―tectonism refers to the deformation of the lithosphere. 
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Tectonic plates are also called lithospheric plates because the crust and the uppermost mantle make up a sublayer of the earth called the lithosphere. The plates can move about because the uppermost mantle, or the asthenosphere, is partially molten and possess a physical property called plasticity, allowing the strong rigid plates of the crust to move over the weaker, softer asthenosphere. 
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Earth‘s crust consists of about a dozen large slabs of rock, or PLATES, that the continents and oceans rest on. These tectonic plates can move centimeters per year— about as fast as your fingernails grow up to 15cm/yr in some places.
                Tectonic plates, or lithospheric plates, are constantly moving, being created, and consumed simultaneously. The motion sometimes results in earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain ranges at the plate boundaries.

                Plate motion is driven by heat escaping from the mantle. The constant movement of heat in the mantle leads to circular convection currents. These hot convective cells are similar to the rolling boil that occurs when water is heated on a stovetop. The flowing mantle has also been compared to a ―conveyor belt, moving the rigid plates in different directions. 
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Fundamentally, convection occurs due to uneven heating and different densities within the liquid.
